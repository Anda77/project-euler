/**
 * The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician
 * in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which
 * is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.<br />
 * <br />
 * We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.<br />
 * <br />
 * There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less
 * than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and
 * denominator.<br />
 * <br />
 * If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms,
 * find the value of the denominator.
